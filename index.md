# About Me
Hi!

I work full time as a software engineer, and generally hack around with code in my spare time too!

I studied _Pure Mathematics & Computer Science_ at the University of Western
Australia. Before I had even reached my second year of Uni, I had already
co-authored a paper at __CSIRO__ on the _Automated Analysis of MicroCT Scanned
Bread Dough_, and interned at __Google__ in Sydnet for 3 months working on Gmail
and Google Drive. I also worked as a front-end developer at Gramercy Studios in
Perth.

From Google, I went on to study honours at University, then interned at
__Facebook London__ where I worked as a front-end developer for some of
Facebooks most used ads interfaces. Working at Facebook scale was an awesome
experience.

I don't just work as a software engineer - it's what I love doing. I'm
constantly setting myself personal projects to push myself and learn new things.
Most of my projects are centred around web technologies and pushing what we can
do in a browser.

Browse some of my work, I'm always posting new stuff up or improving on it.

Cheers.
