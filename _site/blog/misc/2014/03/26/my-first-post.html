<div class="post">
<p>So lately, LinkedIn has been prodding constantly, asking over and over again for me to provide links to some of my work.</p>

<p>And I ignored it.</p>

<p>Recently, I was asked to provide a link to some of my work to demonstrate that what I claimed in my resume is actually true. Of course this makes sense, and I still didn’t have a centralised collection of my work. So I cloned a tonne of repositories into my workspace at <a href="https://koding.com/">Koding</a> and gave them the link to the work hosted there.</p>

<p>Hardly a very good solution.</p>

<p>So, I’ve decided <em>at last</em> to put all the other projects aside for a few hours and put together the start of an online portfolio of sorts.</p>

<p>This took longer than I thought it would.</p>

<p>I like to tinker, and I started off just writing static HTML pages. But that was really dumb. So then, I moved to looking at platforms like Wordpress and Mezzanine.</p>

<p>Wordpress looked good, but I didn’t like how much of a pain it was for me to significantly change it and tinker with it, at least it looked that way from my quick inspection. And it was a bit heavy for what I wanted to do. Plus I needed some hosting for it, forget that.</p>

<p>I played around with Mezzanine, the Django based CMS. I have some experience with Django, so liked the idea behind it, but it also looked like a pain to really quickly make custom pages and such.</p>

<p>Next, I stumbled upon <a href="Jekyll">http://jekyllrb.com/</a>. I could host a static site generated with Jekyll on Github, for free! Great! Jekyll is not a CMS with a tonne of features that I wouldn’t need. I could just define layouts and includes, and write my pages as templates, the Jekyll fills it all out for me. It provides just what I needed.</p>

<p>So, I’m writing this blog post in <strong>Markdown</strong>, and Jekyll is doing the rest. It’s pretty cool. Check back here often for updates (I’m going to look into a RSS feed for Jekyll sites). I’m working on some cool Audio Processing stuff in Javascript, as well as a Tetris playing AI.</p>
