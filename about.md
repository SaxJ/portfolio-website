#About Me
Hi!

I'm a software engineering and pure mathematics student in my final semester of university. Although I've not yet graduated, I've already co-authored a paper at _CSIRO_ on the _Automated Analysis of MicroCT Scanned Bread Dough_, and interned at __Google__ for three months working on a major frontend project for Google Drive. I'm now working at Gramercy Studios as a frontend developer.

I don't just work as a Software Engineer - it's what I love doing. I'm constantly set myself personal projects to push myself. Most of my projects you'll notice are centred around the Web, in particular, the new and exciting Web technologies, like HTML5, CSS3 and all the new stuff that JavaScript can do. I'm really excited about the Web as a platform, and I love pushing what we can do on it.

I'll write blog posts about my work at Gramercy or personal projects, and interesting things in Pure Mathematics.
